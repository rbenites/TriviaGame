# TriviaGame
Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML.


Basic:
You'll create a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options (your choice).

The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz.

The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.
Don't let the player pick more than one answer per question.

Don't forget to include a countdown timer.

Advanced:
You'll create a trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

If the player selects the correct answer, show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, display the next question -- do this without user input.

The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

If the player runs out of time, tell the player that time's up and display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.

If the player chooses the wrong answer, tell the player they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.

On the final screen, show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
